        <p class="p-about"> One of my favourite Boxers inside the ring is former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Lennox Lewis. To me, he has to be put down as the best Boxer to come out of Britain, coming in first-place just before Joe Calzaghe.
        When it comes to saying that a professional fighter is "The Greatest", the proof is in the pudding.  With Lennox, this is certainly the case.  
        You just have to take a look at his resume with hall-of-fame level names such as Mike Tyson, and Evander Holyfield while also having victories against top-ten contenders like Donovan "Razor" Ruddock. To be honest, the only name he 
        doesn't have on his resume is his former Olympic victim, and former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Riddick "Big Daddy" Bowe. Apart from not having fough Riddick Bowe, Lewis has a solid and a hall-of-famer professional boxing record.</p>
