<h1> My Journey into the Sport of Boxing </h1>

<p> I have a burning passion for Boxing.  Boxing is a great sport for young adolescent males with pent-up agression and full of testosterone.
I watch all the big fights, and follow the big names like: Anthony Joshua, Errol Spence, Deontay Wilder, Danny Garcia, Dillian Whyte and Terence Crawford.  
The names listed above would be the guys presently on the scene, and who I particularly enjoy watching.

I have seen a lot of the classic fights and trilogies from the 70's, 80's and 90's such as: Muhammad Ali
vs Joe Frazier III (Thrilla in Manilla), Thomas Hearns vs Marvin Hagler,
and Evander Holyfield vs Riddick Bowe.
</p>

<p> Truth be told, my favourite weight divison in boxing has to be the heavyweight division.  You never know when the fight might end, and the 
underdog always has a punchers chance of causing an upset.  Allow me to spring to your mind the eve of 25th February 1990 when a 42/1 underdog
named James 'Buster' Douglas sent out shockwaves to the boxing world whenever he defeated then Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, 'Iron' Mike Tyson
to cause the biggest upset in boxing history.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8z0xoMze8U" onclick="alert('Directing you to YouTube')"> The Fight can be viewed here. </a>  The Heavyweight division had an element of suprise when 44-year-old George Foreman knocked out 
Michael Moorer to become the oldest Heavyweight champion in the history of the sport.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-WR3qcWp4" onclick="alert('Directing you to Youtube')">George Foreman vs Michael Moore can be viewed here</a>

<h1> Muhammad Ali </h1>

<p> My favourite Boxer inside and outside the ring (particularly outside the ring), is Muhammad Ali.  I respect him as a Boxer, and more importantly, as a man.
He is a TRUE alpha male! Muhammad Ali is a prime example, and the epitome of what a Alpha Male IS.  You can't help but admire the tremndous
courage and heart that Muhammad Ali outwardly projected out to the world with acts such as refusing to be inducted into the United States Armed Forces, as well
as his involuntary, and spontaneous acts of kidness in which he exercised from 
time-to-time. An example of when he has displayed this was when one day he was in LA, when nearby to him, there was a man at the top of a building threatening
to jump off the roof and end his life.  Muhammad Ali ran to the top of the building where this man was, and shouted through the window alongside him, 
"I'm your brother, I want to help you!" After talking to the man for about 20-minutes he was able to change the young man's mind, got him off the roof of the building, and got him into a
mental insitute.

  <p> One of my favourite Boxers inside the ring is former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Lennox Lewis. To me, he has to be put down as the best Boxer to come out of Britain, coming in first-place just before Joe Calzaghe.
  When it comes to saying that a professional fighter is "The Greatest", the proof is in the pudding.  With Lennox, this is certainly the case.  You just have to take a look
  at his resume with hall-of-fame level names such as Mike Tyson, and Evander Holyfield while also having victories against top-ten contenders like Donovan "Razor" Ruddock. To be honest, the only name he 
  doesn't have on his resume is his former Olympic victim, and former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion, Riddick "Big Daddy" Bowe. Apart from not having fough Riddick Bowe, Lewis has a solid and a hall-of-famer professional boxing record.</p>

<h1> Mike Tyson </h1>

<p>Mike Tyson would fight with a high-intensity with powerful pucnhing, fast combinating punching, and swift slipping to avoid punches.  Once the bell rang,
Tyson went out all-guns-blazing straight for the opponent to try take their head off. He was one of few Heavyweights how could put together 'punches in bunches' which enabled him to have some amazing highlight-reel knockouts, usually finished with a left-hook to his opponents jaw.  I think all of the external circumstances which happened outside the ring really
worsened his performances in the ring, and shortened his professional boxing career.  For a short guy only 5'10" he really performed well in against the big guys in the Heavyweight division having the ability to get inside of their jab, and eventually knocking them out.

<h1> Sugar Ray Leonard </h1>

<p> Sugar Ray Leonard was a real showman of a fighter; he understood the theatrical side of the sport. This is a guy who would dance around the ring like his friend Muhamamd Ali, making his opponents miss, taunting them, and doing taunts such as the bolo punch.
Ray Leonard definitley has to go down as not only one of the best Welterweights of all-time, but pound-for-pound overall one the of best to lace-up a pair og boxing gloves.  His resume speaks for itself, with victories over legends, and all-time-greats such as Roberto Duran, Tommy Hearns, and in later years would go on to have the most significant victory of his career over the Undisputed Middleweight Champion, "Marvellous" Marvin Hagler.

<h1> James Toney </h1>

<p> I wouldn't be the biggest connoisseur of defensive, counter-punching fighters, but there was an exception to the rule.
James Toney exhitibed excellent hand-speed, punching-power and defensive boxing abilities in his prime years as a professional.  He won world titles in the Middleweight and Super Middleweight Divisions with wins over greats such as Michael Nunn and Iran Barkley, who were the best around at the time. In the 2000's, he challenged for the world title in the Cruiserweight division
to have a twelve-round war with IBF Champion Vasilly Jirov, knocking him opponent down in the final round to secure a victory.  In 2003, James Toney stepped up to the Heavyweight division to challenge a soon-to-be hall-of-famer in Evander "Real Deal" Holyfield of which he would go on to attain a knockout victory over the legend.
