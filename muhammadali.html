<p class="lead">My favourite Boxer inside and outside the ring (particularly outside the ring), is Muhammad Ali.  I respect him as a Boxer, and more importantly, as a man.
    He is a TRUE alpha male! Muhammad Ali is a prime example, and the epitome of what a Alpha Male IS.  You can't help but admire the tremndous
    courage and heart that Muhammad Ali outwardly projected to the world with acts such as refusing to be inducted into the United States Armed Forces, as well
    as his involuntary, and spontaneous acts of kidness in which he exercised from time-to-time.<br>

    <br> An example of when he has displayed this was when one day he was in L.A., when nearby to him there was a man at the top of a building threatening
    to jump off the roof and end his life.  Muhammad Ali ran to the top of the building where this man was, and shouted through the window alongside him, 
    "I'm your brother, I want to help you!" After talking to the man for about 20-minutes he was able to change the young man's mind, got him off the roof of the building.</p>
